# Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming 

In all languages there are two primary components, the data, and the behavior (the things the program can do). In order to organize things like that, initially had languages that had different ideas of what we could do. There's things like functions and objects that are really important. Learned about Prototypal inheritance, closures, and functions as first class citizens. Objects allow us to do prototypal inheritance. 

**OOP Object Oriented Programming** says that bringing together the data and its behavior in a single location called an object, and containing all of that in a box, makes it easier to understand how our programs work. 

**Functional Programming** says that data and behavior are distinctly different things and should be kept separate fro clarity, so we have multiple boxes instead. 

OOP is like building a robot. Build it all togetehr. FP says give me that data, I'll act upon that data, and return it with something you gave me. 

Idea is to use both paradigms in unison to make our code easy to read, clear, more understandable, more efficient, easy to extend.

The two pillars Closures and Prototypes all us to learn about these topics. Without them, we wouldn't be able to learn about either (Closures for FP and Prototypes for OOP).
