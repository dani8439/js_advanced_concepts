# Functional Programming Intro 

**Functional Programming** is all about separation of concerns. All about packaging our code into separate chunks so everything is well organized. Each part of our code concerns itself with what it deals with. Also separates Data and Function. No correct definition of what is and isn't functional. Generally, functional languages have an emphasis on simplicity where data and functions are concerned. Don't have concepts of classes and methods. Operate on well defined data structures, rather than belonging to that data structure. Goals are the same as OOP. (Clear + Understandable, Easy to Extend, Easy to Maintain, Memory Efficient, DRY).

Have a very important Pillar with FP. **Pure Functions**. There's a separation between the data of a program and the behavior. All objects created in FP are immutable. Once something is created, it cannot be changed. Avoid shared state, adhere to principle of pure functions.
