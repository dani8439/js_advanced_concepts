V-8 Engine. JS Single threaded. Uses a callback queue. JS is an interpreted language.

const isHappy = true;

If gave a computer with a file to read, computer only understands 1's and 0s. When we give it a JS file, it's like me talking to a computer in French. Doesn't understand it. Computer doesn't know what JS is. How can we communicate using a JS file so it displays what we want? 

The JS Engine. A JS Engine allows you to give the JS file to the computer. The machine tells it what to do. It's a translator. The JS Engine understands JS. So now the computer finally understands us. 

There are loads of JS engines. ECMAScript engines. Anytime we use an engine, we give it a JS file, gets understood by the engine and allows us to communicate and for the machine to tell the computer what to do with the JS.
